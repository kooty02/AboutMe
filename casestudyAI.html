    <div class="sectionTitle">ABOUT AUTISM IMPROVISED & RESEARCH INSIGHT
    </div>
    <div class="sectionText">
      <h3>Autism Improvised is a non-profit organization that offers a soft landing space to practice and develop social
        communication ​skills through the magic of improv and theatre.</h3>
      <p>They use the power of applied improv and theatre to help facilitate social communication skills and adaptive
        thinking within people living with mild to moderate Autism. Using a two-pronged support system, AI places an
        emphasis on gaining transitional skills to prepare individuals for entry into the competitive workforce,
        college, and adulthood in general.</p>

      <div class="row">

          <img src="img/AI_OriginalWeb.png" width="100%">
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <div>Autism Improvised was designed to achieve a safe, fun, and beneficial experience for children and young
            adults living with Autism.
          </div>
          <div>However, we have observed that our product or service isn’t meeting these goals, which is causing
            confusion
            towards registration and contacting staff.
          </div>
          <div>We believe adjusting navigation, sprucing up the user interface, and improving the overall experience for
            will achieve higher turn around and happier participants, making Autism Improvised as successful as they can
            be.

    <div class="sectionTitle">BECAUSE LIFE DOES NOT COME WITH A SCRIPT
    </div>
    <div class="sectionText">
      After researching more into the use cases of Autism Improvised as a site and through our conversations with the
      stakeholders, we were able to establish user persona:
      <p>To find a safe place for her grandson who is living with
        autism, Jalen Wilson wants her grandson to be able to recognize and learn social clues with people who are
        similar so that she can feel safe and confident when finally attends college next fall.</p>

    <div class="sectionTitle">INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE
    </div>
    <div class="sectionText">
      <img src="img/AI_SiteMap.png" width="100%">
      Card sorting method was used to establish a more fluid information architecture. Using insights
      gathered from user research strategies, we identified key aspects of the site that needed enhancement:

      <div class="grid-container">
        <div>Structure of home page</div>
        <div>Program descriptions</div>
        <div>Participant portal and information gathering processes</div>
      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="sectionTitle">STYLING AUSTIM IMPROVISED
    </div>
    <div class="sectionText">
      We desired the User Interface to communicate the true essence of the organization.
      The original logo was not projecting the theatrical aspect of Autism Improvised,
      which could lead to some confusion for potential students.
      <img src="img/AI_LogoProposal.png" width="100%">
      The outside A is styled as a puzzle piece to stay true to the purpose of Autism Improvised, but also to elicit
      the
      feeling of a stage, with its centerpiece being the user.
      <img id="caseShadow" src="img/AI_StyleTile.png" width="100%">
      As we were developing our style guide, we desired to
      maintain some of the primary characteristics but iteration was important for increasing their brand awareness.
      Iconography mirrors the new logo created.
    </div>


    <div class="sectionTitle">USER TESTING
    </div>
    <div class="sectionText">
      While designing the prototype, we realized that the way we presented the schedules for each program
      could be confusing for our users. We designed two different ways of presenting the event logistics and tested.
      <img src="img/AI_ABTesting.png" width="100%">
      Through our tests, we found that users prefer a chart-typed B to see all of the
      alternatives, rather than the “info-only” designed type A.

      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="sectionTitle">FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
    </div>
    <div class="sectionText">
      Spending more time researching more people, especially users of Autism Improvised from all points of view
      (volunteers, parents, participants, teachers, etc) could have been beneficial to establish more evidence to
      support the process and design.
