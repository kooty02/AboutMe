    <div class="sectionTitle">ABOUT AUTISM IMPROVISED
    </div>
    <div class="sectionText">
      Autism Improvised is a non-profit organization that offers a soft landing space to practice and develop social
      communication ​skills through the magic of improv and theatre.<br>
      They use the power of applied improv and theatre to help facilitate social communication skills and adaptive
      thinking within people living with mild to moderate Autism. Using a two-pronged support system, AI places an
      emphasis on gaining transitional skills to prepare individuals for entry into the competitive workforce, college,
      and adulthood in general.

        <li>Autism Improvised was designed to achieve a safe, fun, and beneficial experience for children and young
          adults living with Autism.</li>
        <li>However, we have observed that our product or service isn’t meeting these goals, which is causing confusion
          towards registration and contacting staff.</li>
        <li>We believe adjusting navigation, sprucing up the user interface, and improving the overall experience for
          will achieve higher turn around and happier participants, making Autism Improvised as successful as they can
          be.</li>

  <div class="sectionTitle">USER PERSONA
  </div>
  <div class="sectionText">
    After researching more into the use cases of Autism Improvised as a site and through our conversations with the
    stakeholders, we were able to establish user persona.<br>
    To find a safe place for her grandson who is living with
    autism, Jalen Wilson wants her grandson to be able to recognize and learn social clues with people who are similar
    so
    that she can feel safe and confident when finally attends college next fall.

  <div class="sectionTitle">INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE
  </div>
  <div class="sectionText">
    <img src="img/AI_SiteMap.png" width="100%">
    Card sorting method was used to establish a more fluid information architecture. Using insights
    gathered from user research strategies, we identified key aspects of the site that needed enhancement: Structure of
    home page / Program descriptions / Participant portal and information gathering processes
  </div>

  <div class="sectionTitle">STYLE GUIDE
  </div>
  <div class="sectionText">
    We desired the User Interface to communicate the true essence of the organization.
    The original logo was not projecting the theatrical aspect of Autism Improvised,
    which could lead to some confusion for potential students.
    <img src="img/AI_LogoProposal.png" width="100%">
    The outside A is styled as a puzzle piece to stay true to the purpose of Autism Improvised, but also to elicit the
    feeling of a stage, with its centerpiece being the user.
    <img id="caseShadow" src="img/AI_StyleTile.png" width="100%">
    As we were developing our style guide, we desired to
    maintain some of the primary characteristics but iteration was important for increasing their brand awareness.
    Iconography mirrors the new logo created.
  </div>

  <div class="sectionTitle">USER TESTING
  </div>
  <div class="sectionText">
    While designing the prototype, we realized that the way we presented the schedules for each program
    could be confusing for our users. We designed two different ways of presenting the event logistics and tested.
    <img src="img/AI_ABTesting.png" width="100%">
    Through our tests, we found that users prefer a chart-typed B to see all of the
    alternatives, rather than the “info-only” designed type A.

  </div>

  <div class="sectionTitle">FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
  </div>
  <div class="sectionText">
    Spending more time researching more people, especially users of Autism Improvised from all points of view
    (volunteers, parents, participants, teachers, etc) could have been beneficial to establish more evidence to
    support the process and design.
