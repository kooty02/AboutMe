    <div class="sectionTitle">WHY WATER
    </div>
    <div class="sectionText">THE PROBLEM:
      Getting people to drink more water and educating them on how to make it taste better<br>
      THE SOLUTION:
      This water tracking application encourages inactive users to drink more water and helps active users to continue
      to drink water by learning water infusion recipes and tracking their daily consumption.
    </div>

    <div class="sectionTitle">PROJECT DESCRIPTION
    </div>
    <div class="sectionText">H2yO is an application that will increase water consumption and offer healthy additives for
      both active and inactive lifestyles to drink more water and enjoy the flavor.
    </div>


    <div class="sectionTitle">RESEARCH
    </div>
    <div class="sectionText">From our research and feedback from interviews and surveys we discovered the following:
      <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
          <img src="img/NKQB_AffinityDiagram2.jpg" width="100%">
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <li>Users who don't live active lifestyles don't consume the daily minimum required amount.</li>
          <li>Users who are more active would love more information on water infusion recipes.</li>
          <li>Users who are trying to consume more water would like reminders during the day to drink water.</li>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>



    <div class="sectionTitle">USER INSIGHT
    </div>
    <div class="sectionText">I need a smarter way to transition
      to a healthier lifestyle.<br>
      During the interviews we discovered that users would enjoy learning of new ways to make their water taste better
      and remind them to drink.
    </div>

    <div class="sectionTitle">USER PERSONA
    </div>
    <div class="sectionText">
      <img src="img/H2Yo_UserPersona.jpg" width="100%">
      <img src="img/H2Yo_UserPersonaB.jpg" width="100%">
      Introduce challenge of only being able to help users who don't drink much water, we then created another persona that had an active lifestyle in order to make the app cater to both types of users. From that challenge we developed a feature for water infusion recipes and water challenges to get the users to engage with one another.   
      <img src="img/H2Yo_StoryBoard.jpg" width="100%">
    </div>

    <div class="sectionTitle">USER FLOW
    </div>
    <div class="sectionText">Once we added a second persona, we were able to establish new features (infused water and
      water challenges) to the app to encourage active users to consume more water and help them make their goals.

    <div class="sectionTitle">FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
    </div>
    <div class="sectionText">Our journey with H2yo began with an idea, honestly a complaint from a
      friend after doing some web research it grew into a theory which grew stronger from feedback during interviews. We
      were able to include both users with active and inactive lifestyles by adding features such a water infusion
      recipes and competitions in addition to the tracking.
