    <div class="sectionTitle">WHY WATER
    </div>
    <div class="sectionText">
      <p>
        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        Getting people to drink more water and educating them on how to make it taste better.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        This water tracking application encourages inactive users to drink more water and helps active users to continue
        to drink water by learning water infusion recipes and tracking their daily consumption.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        H2Yo is an application that will increase water consumption and offer healthy additives for
        both active and inactive lifestyles to drink more water and enjoy the flavor.
      </p>
    </div>


    <div class="sectionTitle">RESEARCH
    </div>
    <div class="sectionText">
      We began our research by conducting a survey asking about water how much they typically consume, do they feel as
      though they need to consume more and what would help them to reach their consumption goals.
      <p>The interview included questions about their lifestyle to see their level of activeness and knowledge on water
        consumption.
      </p>
      <img src="img/H2Yo_AffinityDiagram.jpg" width="100%">
      From the survey we found that people who were active drink water regularly yet inactive people are less likely
      to consume the recommended health standard amount of 8oz per day.

      From our research and feedback from interviews and surveys we discovered the key findings:

      <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
          <img src="img/H2Yo_IlikeIwishWhatif.jpg" width="100%">
          <img src="img/H2Yo_PrioritizationMatrix.jpg" width="100%">
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <div>Active users don't need to track water consumption yet would like knowledge on water infusion recipes.
          </div>
          <div>Most users don’t drink water on a regular basis because of the lack of taste.
          </div>
          <div>Users prefer having the option to add fruits but would like to know the benefits behind adding them.
          </div>
          <div>Would like reminders on drinking more during the day.
          </div>
          <div>Have certain times a day where they are less likely to drink water.
          </div>
          <div>Other than maintaining hydration not many people know why you should drink water.
          </div>
          <div>Aware of the idea of water infusion but not of how it aids to their health goals.
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="sectionTitle">USER INSIGHT
    </div>
    <div class="sectionText">
      <div class="grid-container">
        <div>
          <h3>"I need a smarter way to transition to a healthier lifestyle."</h3>
        </div>
      </div>
      During the interviews we discovered that users would enjoy learning of new ways to make their water taste better
      and remind them to drink.
    </div>


    <div class="sectionTitle">USER PERSONA
    </div>
    <div class="sectionText">
      Our research showed that we would potentially have 2 types of users:

      <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
          <div class="grid-container">
            <h3>An Inactive User</h3>
            Who doesn't meet the recommended daily amount.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <div class="grid-container">
            <h3>An Active User</h3>
            Who consumes more than the recommended amount.
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <img id="caseBorder" src="img/H2Yo_UserPersona.jpg" width="100%">
      <img id="caseBorder" src="img/H2Yo_UserPersonaB.jpg" width="100%">


      <div class="sectionTitle">STORYBOARD & JOURNEY MAP
      </div>
      <div class="sectionText">
        <img src="img/H2Yo_StoryBoard.jpg" width="100%">
        <img id="caseBorder" src="img/H2Yo_UserJourneyMap.jpg" width="100%">
      </div>


      <div class="sectionTitle">USER FLOW
      </div>
      <div class="sectionText">Once we added a second persona, we were able to establish new features (infused water
        and water challenges) to the app to encourage active users to consume more water and help them make their goals.
        <img src="img/H2Yo_UserFlow.png" width="100%">
        Adding a feature to challenge the user to drink more water by their desired time frame gives them a healthy
        competitive feel and they can compete with themselves, strangers and or friends.
        <p>Consistent feedback of users not knowing why they should or how to infuse their water to reach their
          health goals is what made this feature a priority by having challenges it allows for more positivity and
          feedback
          from other users who can relate.
        </p>
        <img src="img/H2Yo_wireframes.png" width="100%">
        We conclude with an effective water tracking application that does more than track your daily intake of
        water. This application encourages, suggests additives and provides a sense of community for other users to
        enjoy. H2yo has found an effective method to increase water intake for any user.

        <img id="caseShadow" src="img/H2Yo_featureD.gif" width="100%">
      </div>


      <div class="sectionTitle">FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
      </div>
      <div class="sectionText">Our journey with H2Yo began with an idea, honestly a complaint from a
        friend. After doing some web research it grew into a theory which grew stronger from feedback during
        interviews.
        <p> We were able to include both users with active and inactive lifestyles by adding features such a water
          infusion recipes and competitions in addition to the tracking.
        </p>
        <p>Future developments:
        </p>

        <div class="grid-container">
          <div>
            Integrating with other health apps.
          </div>
          <div>
            Users rating the water infusion recipes.
          </div>
          <div>
            More positive affirmations once the goal is met or attempting to be met.
          </div>
        </div>
