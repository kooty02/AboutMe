    <div class="sectionTitle">WHY QUILTING
    </div>
    <div class="sectionText">The quilting industry is doing a terrible job of attracting the under 45 sewists and many
      still behave like they did in the 1970-80's
      <div class="grid-container">
        <div class="item1">The largest percentage of crafters are between 18-34 years old (41%)
        </div>
        <div class="item2">These crafters get most information online and from online videos
        </div>
        <div class="item3">Maker culture emphasizes learning-through-doing (active learning) in a social environment
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="sectionText">Additionally, there has been a renewed interest in hand made crafts as people are looking
        for ways to personalize their belongings.
      </div>

      <div class="sectionTitle">POV STATEMENT
      </div>
      <div class="sectionText">New Kid on the Quilting Block will be designed to teach skill building quilting
        techniques for new quilters. We have observed that most sites aren’t designed to step users through the quilting
        process -
        step by step - which often leads to more questions for new quilters.
      </div>


      <div class="sectionTitle">RESEARCH
      </div>
      <div class="sectionText">We launched a survey and completed one-on-one interviews with people who are currently
        quilters or who are interested in learning to quilt to understand their challenges in getting started and learn
        what they wished they could get help with.

            <img src="img/NKQB_AffinityDiagram2.jpg" width="100%">
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <li>Users were more interested in learning technical skills like 1/4" seam allowances than basic skills</li>
            <li>Time Management was a obstacle to success</li>
            <li>Finding patterns that match their skill levels causes frustrations for new quilters</li>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>



      <div class="sectionTitle">USER PERSONA
      </div>
      <div class="sectionText">Meet Renee! A busy stay-at-home mom who suddenly finds that she has more time on her
        hands now that her daughter is in school full time. Renee is sentimental and has boxes of her daughters outfits
        that she doesn’t want to get rid of, but is running out of room to store.
        <img src="img/NKQB_UserPersona.png" width="100%">
        Renee talks to her friend who shows her a quilt she made with her favorite baby clothes. Renee is intrigued by
        the idea - because it reuses the clothes she has in a meaningful way and it will be something that she can share
        with her daughter when she is older. She finds NKQB and it delighted at the approach they take on teaching a
        beginner!

      <div class="sectionTitle">IDEATION
      </div>
      <div class="sectionText">We have observed that most quilting sites aren’t designed to step new users through the
        process, which often causes confusion. The NKQB site will be designed to teach techniques to increase quilting
        skills for new quilters.
